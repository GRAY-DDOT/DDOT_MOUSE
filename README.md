*This is DDOT's Obsidian Notes Storage
# 1. Repository Rule
1. Usually, it is my rule to write the contents of the study in Korean and the contents related to the project in English.
2. Someday, if I feel that I need to study English, I will try to translate it from Korean to English little by little.
3. The contents uploaded to this repository are what I understood, practiced, and organized through books, search results, lectures, etc. Therefore, it may be similar to or overlap with existing data.
4. Basically, I have intellectual property rights to the entire data in the repository, and opinions and criticism are freely available through email.

Last. 영어 자료를 한글로 번역할 예정은 없습니다.
